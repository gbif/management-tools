Tools for data managers of GBIF.org

This project is a collection of utilities for data managers inside and outside of the GBIF Secretariat.  The tools help managers prioritise effort by providing an overview and also triggering actions such as crawling or deletion of overcrawled data.

These tools target users who are familiar with the GBIF data management processes and standards, including experts throughout the GBIF network.  The toolset aims to include:

  1. The current running crawls monitor (replacing https://crawler.gbif.org)
  2. The summary of over crawled datasets
  3. The IPT synchronisation state for any IPT
  4. The synchronisation state of a Living Atlas when run as a gateway for publishign to GBIF (e.g. Oz, UK)
  5. The crawl history of a dataset 
  6. The crawl logs (ELK)
