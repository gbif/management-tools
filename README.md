Tools for data managers of GBIF.org

This project is a collection of utilities for data managers inside and outside of the GBIF Secretariat.  The tools help managers prioritise effort by providing an overview and also triggering actions such as crawling or deletion of overcrawled data.

These tools target users who are familiar with the GBIF data management processes and standards, including experts throughout the GBIF network.
